# AWS Cloud Lab — User Manual

This manual walks you through deploying, testing, and cleaning up all lab resources step by step.

---

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Academy account** with active lab session (check the Learner Lab console)
- **AWS CLI v2** installed and configured with your Academy credentials
- **Docker** installed and running (Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac, or native on Linux) — *not needed locally if using the EC2 workstation approach below*
- **Python 3.10+** with `pip` (for query generation)
- **[oha](https://github.com/hatoo/oha)** — HTTP load testing tool with native AWS SigV4 support (replaces `hey`)
- **Terminal/shell** access (bash recommended)

### Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
# Expected: your Academy account ID and role

# Check Docker
docker --version

# Check Python
python3 --version
```

### Alternative: EC2-Based Workstation (No Local Docker Required)

If you don't have Docker on your laptop (or want in-region measurements with lower latency), you can run the entire lab from an EC2 instance. A single script automates the setup:

```bash
bash deploy/06-workstation.sh
```

This launches a **t3.small** (2 vCPU, 2 GB) with 20 GB storage, installs Docker, git, pip, jq, and oha via user-data, and clones your repo. It automatically detects the git remote URL from the machine running the script — so if you run it from your GitHub Classroom fork, the workstation gets your fork.

The script uses the pre-created **`vockey`** key pair (available in us-east-1). Download the PEM file from **AWS Details** in the Learner Lab console, save it as `~/.ssh/labsuser.pem`, and set permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/labsuser.pem
```

Wait ~2 minutes after launch, then SSH in:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/labsuser.pem ec2-user@<WORKSTATION_IP>
cd <your-repo-name>
```

The pre-created **LabInstanceProfile** is attached automatically — no credential files needed. Verify with:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

> **Benefit:** Running from an EC2 instance in `us-east-1` eliminates internet latency from your measurements. All traffic stays within the AWS region, giving you cleaner, more accurate results. The workstation also serves as the load generator — no separate instance needed.

> **Cost:** A t3.small costs ~$0.0208/hour. Remember to **stop or terminate** it when you're done.

From here, follow all remaining steps (Step 1 onward) exactly as written — everything works the same.

---

### Configure AWS Credentials

If you are working from your **local machine** (not an EC2 instance with an instance profile), you need to configure credentials manually.

Your AWS Academy credentials are temporary. From the Learner Lab console:

1. Click **AWS Details** → **Show** next to "AWS CLI"
2. Copy the credentials block
3. Paste into `~/.aws/credentials` (replace existing `[default]` section)

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id=ASIA...
aws_secret_access_key=...
aws_session_token=...
```

Set the region:
```bash
aws configure set region us-east-1
```

> **Warning:** These credentials expire after ~4 hours. If commands start failing with `ExpiredTokenException`, repeat this step.

---

## Step 1: Review Configuration

Open `deploy/00-config.sh` and verify:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID           # ← UPDATE THIS
export LAB_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:role/LabRole"
```

Find your account ID:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text
```

Find the LabRole ARN:
```bash
aws iam get-role --role-name LabRole --query 'Role.Arn' --output text
```

---

## Step 2: Build & Push Docker Image (ECR)

```bash
bash deploy/01-ecr.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates an ECR repository named `lsc-knn-app`
2. Logs Docker into ECR
3. Builds the Docker image from `workload/Dockerfile`
4. Tags and pushes to ECR

**Verify:**
```bash
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name lsc-knn-app \
    --image-ids imageTag=latest --query 'imageDetails[0].imageTags'
# Expected: ["latest"]
```

**If it fails:**
- "no basic auth credentials" → re-run `aws ecr get-login-password` (credentials may have expired)
- "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon" → start Docker Desktop or `systemctl start docker`

---

## Step 3: Deploy Lambda (Zip)

```bash
bash deploy/02-lambda-zip.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Builds a NumPy Lambda layer using Docker
2. Publishes the layer to Lambda
3. Packages `handler.py`, `app.py`, `generate_dataset.py` into a zip
4. Creates the Lambda function with the NumPy layer, 512MB memory, X-Ray tracing
5. Creates a Function URL with **IAM auth** (required by Academy accounts)

**The script outputs the Function URL.** Save it — you'll need it for testing.

**Verify:**
```bash
# Test via CLI invoke (bypasses Function URL auth):
aws lambda invoke --function-name lsc-knn-zip \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    --payload "$(python3 -c 'import json; q=json.load(open("loadtest/query.json")); print(json.dumps({"body": json.dumps(q)}))')" \
    /tmp/out.json
cat /tmp/out.json
```

> **Note:** The `--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out` flag is required for AWS CLI v2, which defaults to base64-encoded payloads. The query must be 128-dimensional to match the dataset.

> **Note:** Lambda Function URLs use IAM auth, so plain `curl` will return `403 Forbidden`. The scenario scripts use `oha` with SigV4 signing to handle this automatically.

---

## Step 4: Deploy Lambda (Container)

```bash
bash deploy/03-lambda-container.sh
```

Same as Step 3 but uses the ECR container image instead of a zip package. Save the Function URL.

**Verify:**
```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name lsc-knn-container \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    --payload "$(python3 -c 'import json; q=json.load(open("loadtest/query.json")); print(json.dumps({"body": json.dumps(q)}))')" \
    /tmp/out.json
cat /tmp/out.json
```

---

## Step 5: Deploy Fargate

```bash
bash deploy/04-fargate.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Finds the default VPC and subnets
2. Creates security groups (ALB: port 80, Task: port 8080 from ALB only)
3. Creates an ECS cluster
4. Registers a Fargate task definition (0.5 vCPU, 1 GB, `MODE=server`)
5. Creates an ALB with a target group and listener
6. Creates an ECS service with 1 task
7. Waits for the service to stabilize (~2 minutes)

**The script outputs the ALB DNS name.** Save it.

**Verify:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @loadtest/query.json \
    http://<ALB_DNS>/search
```

**If it fails:**
- "Unable to assume role" → verify LabRole has `ecs:*` and `elasticloadbalancing:*` permissions
- Task stays in PROVISIONING → check CloudWatch logs at `/ecs/lsc-knn-task`
- 502 Bad Gateway from ALB → wait longer (task may still be starting); check target group health:
  ```bash
  aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <TG_ARN>
  ```

---

## Step 6: Deploy EC2 App Instance

```bash
bash deploy/05-ec2-app.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates a security group allowing port 8080 and SSH (port 22)
2. Finds the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
3. Uses the pre-created **LabInstanceProfile** (with LabRole attached)
4. Launches a t3.small with a user-data script that installs Docker, pulls the image from ECR, and starts the container

**The script outputs the public IP.** Wait ~2 minutes for user-data to complete.

**Verify:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @loadtest/query.json \
    http://<EC2_IP>:8080/search
```

**If it fails:**
- Connection refused → user-data may still be running. SSH in and check:
  ```bash
  ssh ec2-user@<EC2_IP>
  sudo docker ps         # should show knn-app container
  sudo docker logs knn-app  # check for errors
  cloud-init status      # should show "done"
  ```
- "LabInstanceProfile not found" → this should be pre-created by AWS Academy. If you are not using Academy, create it manually in the IAM console.

---

## Step 7: Deploy EC2 Workstation (Optional)

```bash
bash deploy/06-workstation.sh
```

This deploys a t3.small in the same region with Docker, git, oha, and the lab repo pre-installed. Use it as both your development environment and load generator. This is optional — you can run tests from your local machine if you have Docker and oha installed locally.

> **Tip:** For the most accurate measurements, run load tests from within AWS (same region). Cross-region/internet latency adds a constant offset to all measurements.

---

## Step 8: Run Load Tests

### Generate the Query Vector

```bash
python3 loadtest/generate_query.py > loadtest/query.json
```

This creates a fixed 128-dimensional query vector (seed=42) used across all tests for reproducibility.

### Save Your Endpoint URLs

Create or edit `loadtest/endpoints.sh`:
```bash
export LAMBDA_ZIP_URL="https://<your-lambda-zip>.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws"
export LAMBDA_CONTAINER_URL="https://<your-lambda-container>.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws"
export FARGATE_URL="http://<your-alb-dns>"
export EC2_URL="http://<your-ec2-ip>:8080"
```

### Install oha

[oha](https://github.com/hatoo/oha) is a load testing tool with built-in AWS SigV4 support. The scenario scripts use it for all targets — Lambda (with IAM auth signing), Fargate, and EC2.

```bash
# Linux (x86_64)
curl -sL https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases/latest/download/oha-linux-amd64 -o oha
chmod +x oha
sudo mv oha /usr/local/bin/   # or: mv oha ~/oha and add ~/oha to PATH

# Mac (Homebrew)
brew install oha
```

The scenario scripts auto-detect `oha` in `PATH` or at `~/oha` and load AWS credentials from `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables.

### Scenario A — Cold Start (requires 20-min idle)

```bash
# Ensure NO requests have been sent to Lambda for 20+ minutes
source loadtest/endpoints.sh
bash loadtest/scenario-a.sh "$LAMBDA_ZIP_URL" "$LAMBDA_CONTAINER_URL"
```

The script sends 30 sequential requests (1/sec) to each Lambda variant, with a 20-minute wait between zip and container. After running, check CloudWatch Logs for cold start entries:

```bash
# Zip cold starts
aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/lsc-knn-zip" \
    --filter-pattern "Init Duration" \
    --start-time $(date -d '30 minutes ago' +%s000) \
    --query 'events[*].message' --output text

# Container cold starts
aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/lsc-knn-container" \
    --filter-pattern "Init Duration" \
    --start-time $(date -d '30 minutes ago' +%s000) \
    --query 'events[*].message' --output text
```

> **Tip:** The filter `"Init Duration"` only matches REPORT lines where a cold start occurred. To see all invocations (warm + cold), filter for `"REPORT"` instead.

> **Tip:** If you get `ResourceNotFoundException`, the log group hasn't been created yet (Lambda creates it on first invocation). List existing log groups with:
> ```bash
> aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix "/aws/lambda/lsc-knn" \
>     --query 'logGroups[*].logGroupName' --output text
> ```

### Scenario B — Warm Throughput

```bash
source loadtest/endpoints.sh
bash loadtest/scenario-b.sh "$LAMBDA_ZIP_URL" "$LAMBDA_CONTAINER_URL" "$FARGATE_URL" "$EC2_URL"
```

The script warms up all targets, then runs 500 requests at two concurrency levels: Lambda at c=5 and c=10 (Academy limit), Fargate/EC2 at c=10 and c=50. Results are saved to `results/scenario-b-*.txt`.

> **AWS Academy constraint:** Lambda concurrency is capped at 10 (max 10 concurrent execution environments). Do not manually run load tests with higher concurrency against Lambda — exceeding service limits may result in account deactivation.

### Scenario C — Burst from Zero (requires 20-min Lambda idle)

```bash
# Ensure Lambda has been idle 20+ minutes
source loadtest/endpoints.sh
bash loadtest/scenario-c.sh "$LAMBDA_ZIP_URL" "$LAMBDA_CONTAINER_URL" "$FARGATE_URL" "$EC2_URL"
```

The script fires 200 requests to all four targets simultaneously: Lambda at c=10 (Academy limit), Fargate/EC2 at c=50. Results are saved to `results/scenario-c-*.txt`.

---

## Step 9: Collect Results

All `oha` output is saved to `results/`. Additionally collect:

```bash
# Export CloudWatch REPORT lines (Lambda cold start data)
aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/lsc-knn-zip" \
    --filter-pattern "REPORT" \
    --start-time $(date -d '3 hours ago' +%s000) \
    --query 'events[*].message' --output text > results/cloudwatch-zip-reports.txt

aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/lsc-knn-container" \
    --filter-pattern "REPORT" \
    --start-time $(date -d '3 hours ago' +%s000) \
    --query 'events[*].message' --output text > results/cloudwatch-container-reports.txt
```

Take screenshots of:
- AWS pricing pages (Lambda, Fargate, EC2) with the date visible
- X-Ray traces showing cold start Init segments (optional but recommended)

---

## Step 10: Clean Up

**Critical — do this before closing your session!**

```bash
bash deploy/99-cleanup.sh
```

This terminates EC2 instances, deletes the ECS service/cluster/ALB, removes Lambda functions and layers, deletes the ECR repository, and removes security groups.

**Verify cleanup:**
```bash
# Should show no running instances with lsc-knn tags
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=lsc-knn-*" "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" \
    --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId' --output text

# Should fail (repo deleted)
aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names lsc-knn-app 2>&1 | head -1
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| `ExpiredTokenException` | Academy session expired (~4hr) | Re-export credentials from Learner Lab console |
| `403 Forbidden` on Lambda URL | Lambda Function URL requires IAM auth | Deploy scripts already use `AWS_IAM`; scenario scripts handle signing via `oha --aws-sigv4` |
| Fargate task stuck in PROVISIONING | Image pull failure or role permissions | Check `/ecs/lsc-knn-task` CloudWatch logs; verify LabRole has ECR permissions |
| EC2 `Connection refused` on port 8080 | User-data still running | Wait 2 min; SSH in and check `docker ps` |
| ALB returns 502 | Target not yet healthy | Wait for health check to pass; check target group health |
| `oha` not found | Not installed | `curl -sL https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases/latest/download/oha-linux-amd64 -o ~/oha && chmod +x ~/oha` |
| Lambda zip import error | NumPy not in layer or handler imports Flask | Verify layer is attached; `handler.py` should NOT import Flask |
| Different `results` arrays across endpoints | Different dataset seed or query | All must use seed=0 for dataset and seed=42 for query |

### Checking Logs

```bash
# Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/lsc-knn-zip --since 10m

# Fargate/ECS logs
aws logs tail /ecs/lsc-knn-task --since 10m

# EC2 user-data output
ssh ec2-user@<IP> 'sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'
```

### Re-running a Single Deployment Step

All deploy scripts are idempotent — they check for existing resources before creating new ones. You can safely re-run any script if it failed partway through.

To force re-creation, delete the specific resource first:
```bash
# Example: delete and re-create Lambda zip
aws lambda delete-function --function-name lsc-knn-zip
bash deploy/02-lambda-zip.sh
```
